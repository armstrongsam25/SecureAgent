# Dynamic Security Project

This repository contains the Dynamic Authorization Framework (DAF) for AI Agents. It is designed to provide "Identity as Code" for agentic workflows, abstracting away the complexities of OIDC and Keycloak.

## 📦 Agentic Security Package

The core of this project is the `agentic-security` Python package. It provides a high-level API for agents to automatically register themselves and exchange tokens securely.

**[👉 Go to Agentic Security Package](./agentic-security/README.md)**

### Key Features
- **Zero-Touch Registration**: Agents auto-register with the Identity Provider on first boot.
- **Auto-Validation**: Easy-to-use FastAPI dependencies for token verification.
- **Token Exchange**: Simple API to exchange user tokens for downstream service access (RFC 8693).

## 🧪 Proof of Concept (Legacy)

The `poc/` directory contains the original scripts and experiments used to validate the architecture. It serves as a reference implementation and test bed.

**[👉 Go to POC Documentation](./poc/README.md)**

## Project Structure

- `agentic-security/`: The reusable, pip-installable package.
- `poc/`: Experimental scripts and raw implementation files.
